# VOWL Shapes Library for Draw.io

[VOWL: Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/v2/) defines a visual language for the user-oriented representation of ontologies. It provides graphical depictions for elements of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that are combined to a force-directed graph layout visualizing the ontology.

[Draw.io](https://draw.io) is a web based diagramming application built on mxGraph, that integrates with Google Drive , OneDrive and Dropbox. draw.io is also a plugin for Atlassian's Confluence and JIRA.

## How to install

* Open draw.io in your browser
* Go to File -> Open Library from -> URL...
* Put the url of the VOWL.xml.

In the end you should see a new library in the left sidebar.
